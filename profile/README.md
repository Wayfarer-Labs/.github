## Our Mission

We're making world models accessible to everyone. Through open science and community collaboration, we're building AI models that run locally on your hardware - no cloud required. Our models achieve hundreds of FPS on RTX 5090s and 60 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson for robotics applications.

## Key Technologies

### üöÄ Real-time World Generation
- **100s of FPS** on RTX 5090
- **60 FPS** on NVIDIA Jetson (360p)
- Optimized for consumer hardware
- No cloud computing required

### ü§ñ Robotics Deployment
- NVIDIA Jetson optimized
- Real-time inference for autonomous systems
- 360p at 60 FPS for embedded applications

### ‚ö° Model Distillation
- ODE regression enables 3.5x speedup
- Prune 50% of layers with minimal quality loss
- Production-ready optimization techniques

### üß™ Human Evaluation Platform
- [OWL Eval](https://eval.wayfarerlabs.ai) - First open-source evaluation platform for AI-generated videos
- Reveals critical model failures that automated metrics miss
- Understand human perception of AI content

## Major Research Projects

### 3D Consistency
Depth map integration and point cloud conditioning for spatially coherent world generation.

### Long-term Spatiotemporal
Solving temporal flickering through frame-pair training and optical flow conditioning.

### Novel Architectures
Diffusion transformers for decoding, hierarchical VAE-GANs, and self-forcing for KV cache optimization.

### Embedded Devices
Models run anywhere from Steam Deck to iPhone, achieving real-time performance without cloud infrastructure.
